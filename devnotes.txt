IPV4ADDR: Your IPv4 endpoint.  Set to AUTO to determine your IP based on the IP you requested this page from.  Previously passed as ipv4b.
PASSKEY : Your tunnel update key, or MD5 hash of your tunnelbroker.net password if a tunnel specific key is not set.  You may be able to 'echo -n YOURPASSWORD | md5sum' to produce the MD5 hash of your password.
USERID  : The UserID shown on the main page of tunnelbroker.net when you log in.
TUNNELID: The ID of the tunnel you're updating the endpoint on.  This can be found on the tunnel information page.  Previously referred to as the Global Tunnel ID / tunnel_id.

The following parameters are only usable when accessing this script over https.
USERNAME: Your tunnelbroker.net username.
PASSWORD: Your tunnel update key, or tunnelbroker.net password if a tunnel specific key is not set.

The legacy parameter names will continue to work for the forseable future.  Naming of them changed to be more in line with industry convention and their roles.
